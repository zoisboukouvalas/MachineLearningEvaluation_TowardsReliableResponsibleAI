This chapter aims to introduce the basic elements of statistics necessary to understand the more advanced concepts and procedures that will be introduced in later chapters. Needless to say, rather than trying to be exhaustive we will discuss the most relevant concepts. Furthermore, this overview will have more of a functional than an analytical bias, our goal being to encourage a better practice in machine learning. In certain cases, this chapter will provide a brief introduction to a topic, which will then be developed in more detail in later chapters. 

The chapter is divided into four sections. In the first section, we define the notion of random variables and their associated quantities. The second section then introduces the concept of probability distributions and then discusses one of the extremely important results in statistics theory, the central limit theorem. The third section discusses the notion of confidence intervals, while the last subsection briefly covers the basics behind hypothesis testing and discusses the concepts of Type I and Type II error and power of a test. If the reader is already acquainted with these concepts, they can confidently omit this chapter.
