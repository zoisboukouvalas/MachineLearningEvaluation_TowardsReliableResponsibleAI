Along with the robustness issues discussed in Chapter 10 comes the question of responsibility. Responsible machine learning is an approach to developing and deploying machine learning models that prioritize ethical considerations, fairness, transparency, and accountability. It is a subset of responsible artificial intelligence (AI) (Brundage et al. 2020; Kaur et al. 2022; Li et al. 2023) that focuses specifically on the development and deployment of responsible AI systems. While Chapter 10 raised some of the questions asked in this chapter, it did not provide complete answers to them. The purpose of this current chapter is to review the work that has been done toward answering these questions.
