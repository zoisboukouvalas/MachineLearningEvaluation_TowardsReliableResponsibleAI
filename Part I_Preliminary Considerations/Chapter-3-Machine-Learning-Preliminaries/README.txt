This chapter is aimed at establishing the conceptual foundation of the relevant aspects of machine learning on which the book rests. This very brief overview is in no way exhaustive. Rather, our main aim is to elucidate the relationship of these concepts to the performance evaluation of learning algorithms. 

The chapter is divided into five sections. In the first section, we briefly present the differences between human and machine learning. In the second section, we go through supervised learning, the notion of risk and loss function, generalization error, and different learning algorithms. In the third section, we provide a discussion on unsupervised learning and briefly present the basic idea of clustering, dimensionality reduction, latent variable modeling, and generative learning. In the fourth section, we go through the challenges of learning and provide a detailed discussion on the bias variance trade-off. The chapter concludes with the fifth section where we put all machine learning components that we discussed in previous sections in perspective and discuss them in the context of evaluation for machine learning.
