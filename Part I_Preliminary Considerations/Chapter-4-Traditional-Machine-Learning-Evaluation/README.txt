When first introduced to the field of machine learning, students and practitioners are typically informed about the importance of evaluating their models. They are also introduced to some standard ways to proceed with that evaluation. This chapter presents a review of these standard techniques and discusses why, while these procedures are very useful as a start, they are not sufficient in all cases. The first section discusses why it is important to evaluate machine learning systems, presents the main tenets of evaluation, and discusses the evaluation process for different types of common machine learning problems (binary and multi-class classification, regression analysis and clustering). The second section looks at the well-known metrics in use for these problems including metrics derived from the confusion matrix, as well as several distance and similarity metrics.    
The third section reviews the best known error-estimation procedures including the hold-out method and cross-validation, while the fourth section reviews two common statistical tests: the t-test and the sign test. Finally, the fifth section discusses why all the evaluation methods presented in the chapter are a good beginning but why they are not sufficient in many cases.
